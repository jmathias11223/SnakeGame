Snake Game

This was a small individual project I made in my free time. It models the basic game Snake and uses Java Swing as the basis for the GUI.

How to play:
- The board will load in and the up, down, left, and right keys are used to navigate the snake
- The way to win is to collect as many apples as possible by navigating the snake to the apple and "eating" it. Once an apple is eaten, a new one will randomly generate.
- In the current version, there is a maximum score of 50 set as a "winning" score. There is also a time limit of 190 seconds.
